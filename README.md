### Hi there 👋

I'm Johnpaul, a self-taught web guy (frontend, backend & some server stuff).

🎮 I have a BSc in Games Software Development which I earned at the Glasgow Caledonian University.

💬 Somehow, I've ended up becoming a Financial Administrator within the Finance Office at The University of Glasgow. It's actually quite fun because there's lots of opportunities for me to create scripts to help improve processes (like [this](https://github.com/boxtar/planner_adjustment), and [this](https://github.com/boxtar/supplement_planner_uploads)).

🔭 I'm currently working on [an application](https://reminders.ayex.co.uk) that sends Email and/or SMS and/or Telegram notifications at a given date and time with optional recurrences (hourly, daily, etc). The main reason behind this is to remind me to read articles, watch useful videos, pickup porridge, and get a haircut.
Why didn't I just use one of the many existing applications that can do this for me? Because that doesn't help me learn Unit Testing, Software Design Principles, Cron Jobs, Domain Oriented Design, etc.

⭐ Problems are opportunities
