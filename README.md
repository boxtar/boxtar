### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Johnpaul, a self-taught web guy (frontend, backend & some server stuff).

I have a BSc in Games Software Development which I earned at the Glasgow Caledonian University.

Somehow, I've ended up becoming a Financial Administrator within the Finance Office at The University of Glasgow. It's actually quite fun because there's lots of opportunities for me to create scripts to help improve processes (like [this](https://github.com/boxtar/planner_adjustment), and [this](https://github.com/boxtar/supplement_planner_uploads)).

I'm currently working on [an application](https://reminders.ayex.co.uk) that sends Email and/or SMS and/or Telegram notifications at a given date and time with optional recurrences (hourly, daily, etc). The main reason behind this is to remind me to read artices or watch videos that I have came across during my day, but never had the time to spend (it's also handy for reminding me to pick up yogurt).
Why didn't I just use one of the many existing applications that can do this for me? Because then I wouldn't have learned all of the awesome things I did like Unit Testing, Software Design Principles, Cron Jobs and Domain Oriented Design. Also, I like how quickly I can load it up and add/edit reminders in a browser app.
